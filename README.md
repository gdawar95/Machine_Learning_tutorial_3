# Machine_Learning_tutorial_3
3rd Tutorial in line to help budding data scientists get familiar with basic concepts of ML and Statistics

## PCA

Tutorial 3 is structured a bit differently than Tutorial 1 and 2 - here, all the code for the tutorial part is given. You're encouraged to read closely, adjust and experiment to make sure you fully understand what the code is doing. Once you have a firm grasp of PCA, you should be in great shape for the exercises at the end.

Please open the notebook and begin the learning process!
